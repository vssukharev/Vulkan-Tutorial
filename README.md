# Vulkan-Tutorial

My first dwelling into computer graphics overall and with Vulkan, in particular.


Commands (go to directory working-triangle if you want to check the working one)
```console
$ make run       # compile and run
$ make shaders   # compile shaders only
$ make debug     # compile with debug flag
$ ./build/test   # run compiled app
```
